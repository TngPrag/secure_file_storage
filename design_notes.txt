Project Structure and Design approach
=====================================

This project structure is organized for maintainability, scalability, and 
separation of concerns, which aligns with Django's philosophy of clean and modular design.
1. app/configs/

    Purpose: This folder contains configuration files that define the behavior and setup of the entire Django application.
    Contents:
        settings.py: Stores the project's settings like database configurations, installed apps, middleware, etc.
        urls.py: Manages the project's main URL routing. It includes references to the app-specific routes found in the routers/ folder.
        wsgi.py: Serves as an entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers to serve the project.
    Functionality: Centralizes configuration settings, enabling easy changes to core aspects of the project without affecting other parts of the code.

2. app/fs/

    Purpose: This folder contains file storage logic, handling where and how files are stored (local filesystem or cloud services like Amazon S3).
    Contents:
        storage.py: Provides functions for storing files in the file system or in an S3 bucket.
    Functionality: Abstracts the file storage mechanism, making it easy to switch between local and cloud storage without changing the business logic.

3. app/logic/

    Purpose: This folder contains core functionality and business logic, separating the core processes from higher-level operations.
    Subfolders:
        core/: Holds fundamental functions that can be reused across different parts of the project.
            encryption.py: Provides encryption functions (e.g., generating keys, encrypting files).
        handlers/: Contains business logic that combines core functionality and application logic.
            file_handler.py: Handles file uploads, encryption, and storage, integrating functionality from both core/ and fs/.
    Functionality: Ensures that core logic and business rules are modular and reusable across different parts of the application.

4. app/routers/

    Purpose: Contains URL routing logic specific to the application's views, keeping routing isolated from the rest of the logic.
    Contents:
        file_routes.py: Defines the routes (URL endpoints) for file upload operations, rendering views and handling requests.
    Functionality: Ensures that URL routing logic is clearly separated from business logic, enabling easier modifications to the routing layer.



5. manage.py

    Purpose: Django’s default command-line utility for executing tasks like running the development server, migrations, and more.
    Functionality: Provides a convenient way to interact with Django’s internals.

6. README.md

    Purpose: Provides project documentation, explaining the purpose, structure, and setup instructions for the project.
    Functionality: Helps other developers to understand and get started with the project quickly.

7. requirements.txt

    Purpose: Lists the dependencies required for the project.
    Functionality: Ensures that all the necessary packages are installed in the environment.

This structure is very well-suited for large-scale, maintainable Django projects for several reasons:

    Separation of Concerns:
        Each folder handles a specific aspect of the project, 
        e.g., fs/ for file storage, logic/ for business and core logic, and routers/ 
        for URL routing. This makes the project modular, easier to maintain, and allows 
        changes to one part of the system without affecting others.

    Scalability:
        As the project grows, it's easier to add new functionality or services 
        without cluttering existing files. For example, you can easily add new routes 
        in routers/ or new business logic in logic/handlers/.

    Modularity:
        By organizing the code into distinct modules (fs, core, handlers), 
        it's easier to reuse or modify parts of the application, such as switching 
        from local file storage to cloud storage (S3) without changing much of the codebase.

    Adaptability:
        This structure makes it easy to adapt to other frameworks or technologies in the future. 
        For example, if you want to move file handling to another service, you would only need to update the fs/ folder.

    Project Complexity:
        This structure might be more complex than the default Django project structure, 
        but it's ideal for more advanced projects. For simpler applications, this structure 
        might feel like overkill.

Comparison with Typical Django Structure

In a standard Django project, most of the functionality would be contained in the views.py, 
models.py, and urls.py files within the app folders. However, this approach can lead to 
bloated files and a harder-to-maintain structure over time, especially for larger projects.

The structure above is more aligned with "Domain-Driven Design" principles and clean architecture, which are better suited for larger and more complex projects. It makes the project:

    More maintainable.
    Easier to test.
    Easier to scale as the business logic grows.
